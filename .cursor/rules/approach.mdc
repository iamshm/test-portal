- Follow the instructions in .cursor/Instructions.md 
- Implement the phases one by one/
- Dont implement anything all at once
- Always give a plan and implement code change only when I explicity ask to
- After every implementation, update the .cursor/Completed.md mentioning what change was introduced. Keep the file Completed.md even in phased manner
